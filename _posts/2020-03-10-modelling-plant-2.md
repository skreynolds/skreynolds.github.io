title: "modelling the turbine and generator"

When considering a single area power system, there are three main components that the literature focuses on:

* Governor: used for controlling the angular velocity (and frequency) of the system;
* Turbine, which provides the mechanical torque to drive the generator; and
* Generator and electrical load: desciribes the electrical power that is produced and the electrical torque from connected loads. 

This post will cover the basics of how the literature models the turbine and the generator, and will draw heavily from Kothari's awesome book: *Modern Power Systems Analysis*.
