JabRef is dead. Long live JabRef!

Oh man, so I wrong wrong wrong about sticking with that earlier version of JabRef!

So I was happily using my version 2.10 of JabRef, and then one day it just stopped working on my laptop. I tried to fix it, but it was having trouble accessing the version of Java that it required.

After some bungling around trying resolve the issue, I cut my losses and uninstalled 2.10. I then grabbed version 13.0.2 of Java and downloaded 5.0 of JabRef. Installation was easy peasy, and then I just had to amend a few fields in the references that I had from my original 2.10 database.

New JabRef works amazingly! I worked out how to pull references from external platforms like IEEE straight into my database so I don't have to type things out. The formatting of the db file still works fine with BibLatex, so it's all gravy.

Commands are almost exactly the same, except the interface is much slicker. The takeaway here is don't be a derp like me and just go striaght to version 5.0!
