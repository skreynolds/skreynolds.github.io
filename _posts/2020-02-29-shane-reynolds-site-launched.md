Okay.

So this marks the beginning of my blog. Mostly I want to use this blog to document my thoughts, or interesting things that I find while undertaking research for my thesis in Electrical Engineering. What am I researching for my thesis? I'm interested in doing something in power systems modelling which uses a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent for control. I think I'll focus on frequency control.

As an aside, I'm pretty stoked with this blog I've built. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It provides support for MathJax so I can create beautiful inline equations such as this cheeky fellow $$ v = i \cdot R $$. Also it provides support for block equations too:

<div style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #333;">$$ e^{i \cdot \pi} + 1 = 0 $$</div>
