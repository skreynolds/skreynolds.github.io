Okay.

So this marks the beginning of my blog. Mostly I want to write about things that interest me while I'm undertaking research for my thesis in Electrical Engineering. What am I researching for my thesis? I'd like to pursue something in the field of robotics. Bipedal robots are cool. I realise that it might be difficult to pursue an undergraduate thesis in this field. The people who I've talked to suggest that I should remain flexible in my endeavours which is what I'll try to do. 

As an aside, I'm pretty stoked with this blog I've built. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
